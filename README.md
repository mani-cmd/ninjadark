## This is a fun project to work on

You can report any issues regarding this theme.
This theme is an inspiration theme from One Dark Pro and Dracula and, I added some colors to it. I am not that creative in naming things, but I am a huge fan of anime, especially Naruto. So I called it **_Ninja dark_**
